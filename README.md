# Smart Manufacturing Analytics Dashboard

Welcome to Smart Manufacturing Analytics, a dashboard for collecting, processing, and analyzing data from different systems within a manufacturing plant to generate actionable insights that can help manufacturers make data-driven decisions. 

By using our solution, manufacturers can gain valuable insights into their production processes, allowing them to make informed decisions that lead to increased efficiency, reduced downtime, and improved product quality. Our solution utilizes various data analysis techniques and tools to achieve these goals and is designed to be flexible and adaptable to the unique needs of individual manufacturers.


## Technologies used


This project utilizes a variety of technologies to collect, process, and analyze data from manufacturing systems. These include:

### PySpark:
PySpark is an open-source library for Python that allows for data processing and analysis using the Spark framework. It allows for the handling of large datasets and the ability to perform complex data operations.
### DataLake:
A data lake is a centralized repository that allows for the storage of raw, unstructured data at any scale. It provides a single source of truth for all data in the manufacturing plant.
### Databricks:
Databricks is a cloud-based platform for data engineering, machine learning, and analytics. It allows for the creation of data pipelines and the ability to run PySpark scripts.
### PowerBI:
Power BI is a business intelligence tool that allows for the creation of interactive visualizations and reports. It allows for the representation of data in a user-friendly format.
### Kafka:
Kafka is an open-source message broker that allows for the real-time processing of data streams. It allows for the integration of data from various sources in real-time.
### Python:
Python is a programming language that is used for data processing and analysis. It allows for the creation of scripts and the ability to work with various libraries such as PySpark and Pandas.

## Objective:
The objective of the project is to develop a cockpit dashboard that can collect data from various systems connected to the manufacturing plant, clean and process the data, and generate real-time and historical reports. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the plant's operations, including machine utilization, production rates, quality control metrics, and real-time temperature variations of machinery components.

## Scope:
The scope of this project includes the development of a cockpit dashboard that can collect and process data from the MES and IoT-enabled temperature sensors. The dashboard displays real-time and historical data in a user-friendly format and provide alerts and notifications for any anomalies or issues detected. Additionally, the project scope includes the development of data pipelines to collect, clean and process the data from different sources.
